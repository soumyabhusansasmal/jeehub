		<p>The Indian Institutes of Technology are facing a faculty crunch. The situation is worrying and it is estimated that a decade would be needed to achieve the ideal Faculty-Student ratio. The Government rules stipulate that all IITs need to have a teacher-student ratio of 1:10 but the ground figures point otherwise.

IIT Faculty numbers at existing levels:

6,522 are the sanctioned faculty positions available in the IITs nationwide with about 2,618 remaining unfulfilled leading to a 40% shortage. The student intake has increased by 54% since 2006 with the advent of the 27% OBC quota as well as the expansion of the number of seats though the teacher student ratio has remained at 1:15.

IIT Roorkee is the worst hit with a teacher student ratio 1: 20 while newer ones like IIT-Ropar and IIT-Mandi possess a good teacher student ratio of 1: 2. The national faculty strength (combined) shows a figure of 3,904 for now though the trend is alarming. The student strength is rising while the teacher number is dwindling. It is estimated that another 5 to 10 years may be needed to get the Teacher Student Ratio on par.

The IIT-Bombay director Devang Khakhar feels that the faculty quality has improved with most of the recruits having overseas Ph.Ds and international teaching or working experience. The emphasis is on the quality of teaching faculty hence the shortage as per the IIT-Roorkee director Pradipto Banerjee who also feels that there should be no compromise on the quality while mentioning that the institute is looking for good faculty.


New Technical staff for Lab Maintenance:

The HRD ministry has given the green signal for the creation of a new cadre of technical staff aimed at maintenance and manning of the laboratories at the tech schools thus lifting the burden off the shoulders of the faculty and staff who were previously in charge of this. This move ensures the freeing of the faculty members from the lab responsibility leaving them to devote more time to teaching and research.

The general feeling is that the labs are sophisticated and full of modern equipment requiring dedicated qualified staff to man and maintain them. Each of the IITs have been asked to submit their requirements in this regard for recruitment of such staff subject to the approval of the finance ministry.
