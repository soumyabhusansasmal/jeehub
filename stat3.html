		<p>Indian Institute of Technology (IITs) have agreed to start the process of accreditation by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA). The NBA is a premier accreditation body in India and after long wait IITs have agreed to get themselves accredited by the accreditation body NBA.

Though, IITs have been given freedom to conduct and carry out the review process themselves and submit the report to the NBA. This is done considering that IITs have high academic standards and reputation in the country.

HRD Minister M M Pallam Raju after the IIT Council Meeting said that the agreement by IITs to take part in the accreditation process would also help India to become part of the Washington Accord, an International Agreement among accrediting agencies which gives recognition and accreditation to engineering degree programs of each other in 14 countries.

Currently, India is a provisional member of Washington Accord. One of the crucial condition is that the Engineering colleges of the country should be accredited. Till now, the IITs were reluctant to take part in the accreditation process.

The HRD Minister was asked a lot of questions regarding this exception done for the IITs for internal assessment and if other institutions also seek similar internal assessment process to be adopted by them rather than done by NBA officials. Ashok Thakur, Education Secretory said that the IITs proposal will be now taken to the NBA.

In the recently released QS World Universities Ranking 2013, No Indian Institute/University made it to the top 200. When compared to last year nearly all the IITs saw a dip in their International Ranking as well as Asia Rankings.
